                    <p> A personal reinterpretation of 'Flappy bird' developed in order to entice other students of my institute to videogame development first.
                        The second achivement was to teach them several basic and practical skills to succeed in their own following projects.
                        Actually, the end of this course should have been wrapped up with a final jam among peers sadly no longer arranged.
